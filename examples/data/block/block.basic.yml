      To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the opening for signature of
      the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) a number of high-level
      events are being organized throughout 2016. This publication was launched
      to coincide with the Ministerial Meeting in June 2016. It relates the
      genesis of the Treaty since the creation of the Conference on Disarmament
      of 1979, as well as the challenges and achievements toward the entry
      into force that have taken place over the last twenty years.
